	Abstract = {Software-Defined Networking
(SDN) adapts logically-centralized control by
decoupling control plane from data plane and
provides the efficient use of network resources. However, due to the limitation of traditional routing strategies relying on manual configuration, SDN may suffer from link congestion
and inefficient bandwidth allocation among
flows, which could degrade network performance significantly. In this paper, we propose
EARS, an intelligence-driven experiential network architecture for automatic routing. EARS
adapts deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to
simulate the human methods of learning experiential knowledge, employs the closed-loop
network control mechanism incorporating with
network monitoring technologies to realize
the interaction with network environment. The
proposed EARS can learn to make better control decision from its own experience by interacting with network environment and optimize
the network intelligently by adjusting services
and resources offered based on network requirements and environmental conditions.
Under the network architecture, we design the
network utility function with throughput and delay awareness, differentiate flows based on
their size characteristics, and design a DDPGbased automatic routing algorithm as DRL decision brain to find the near-optimal paths for
mice and elephant flows. To validate the network architecture, we implement it on a real
network environment. Extensive simulation
results show that EARS significantly improve
the network throughput and reduces the average packet delay in comparison with baseline
schemes (e.g. OSPF, ECMP)},

	Abstract = {ROADMs: These devices are located within the network nodes, and they route chunks of optical spectrum among fiber directions, filtering, attenuating and amplifying the optical signals as they travel through.

This paper describes a next step in our development, a set of 1U  modules for building Flexgrid, Colorless, Directionless and Contentionless ROADM nodes in an open manner.

A fixed-grid ROADM  with NETCONF northbound control interface was introduced in 2016.

Components:
Wavelength Selective Switches (WSS)

A Colorless port is a client-facing port which can be reconfigured to carry any ``color'' (wavelength) of light.  
Directionless capability means that the signal passing through a given client port can be routed towards any line degree.

Spectrum Monitoring
PDs measure the intensity of light which is hitting the PD's active area.

Optical Channel Monitor (OCM). An OCM can be modeled as a serial combination of a filter, possibly tunable, followed by a photodiode. In a flexgrid ROADM, the OCM is typically also capable of flexgrid operation.

Amplification
The most common device used for amplification is an ErbiumDoped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA)
